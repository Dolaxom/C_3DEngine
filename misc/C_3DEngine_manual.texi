@chapter C_3DEngine

This is a School 21 educational project - an implementation of a program to view 3D wireframe models (3D Viewer) in the C programming language with the additional use of OpenGL, Qt and QtGifImage libraries.
All the values inserted in C_3DEngine's input fields while running the application don't affect the actual model file in an way as C_3DEngine is a program made for the model viewing purposes only.

@chapter C_3DEngine provides the ability to:
- view any applicable .obj file in the filesystem that contains at least up to a 1,000,000 polygons;
- parse .obj files with unconvential number of polygons;
- acquire information on the amount of edges and vertices that the model contains;
- change position, rotation and scale of the model;
- switch the view between perspective and orthogonal projections;
- apply several color and style settings to the display field;
- take a screenshot of the display field and save it in .jpg or .bmp image formats;
- record the display field as a .gif (10fps, any length).

@chapter Controls:
@strong{[left mouse button]} - change position of the model on the x, y axis
@strong{[right mouse button]} - change rotation of the model on the x, y axis
@strong{[mouse scroll wheel]} - change position of the model on the z axis
@strong{[enter]} - apply settings and/or redraw
@strong{[tab]} - switch focus between input fields
@strong{[F11]} - window fullscreen mode
@strong{[escape]} - exit
