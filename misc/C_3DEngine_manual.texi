This is a @strong{School 21 educational project} - an implementation of a program to view 3D wireframe models (@strong{3D Viewer}) in the @strong{C programming language} with the additional use of @strong{OpenGL}, @strong{Qt} and @strong{QtGifImage} libraries.
All the values inserted in @strong{C_3DEngine}'s input fields while running the application don't affect the actual model file in an way as @strong{C_3DEngine} is a program made for the model viewing purposes only.

@strong{C_3DEngine provides the ability to:}
@enumerate
@item
- view any applicable .obj file in the filesystem that contains at least up to a 1,000,000 polygons;
@item
- parse .obj files with unconvential number of polygons;
@item
- acquire information on the amount of edges and vertices that the model contains;
@item
- change position, rotation and scale of the model;
@item
- switch the view between perspective and orthogonal projections;
@item
- apply several color and style settings to the display field;
@item
- take a screenshot of the display field and save it in .jpg or .bmp image formats;
@item
- record the display field as a .gif (10fps, any length).
@end enumerate

@strong{Controls:}
@enumerate
@item
@strong{[left mouse button]} - change position of the model on the x, y axis
@item
@strong{[right mouse button]} - change rotation of the model on the x, y axis
@item
@strong{[mouse scroll wheel]} - change position of the model on the z axis
@item
@strong{[enter]} - apply settings and/or redraw
@item
@strong{[tab]} - switch focus between input fields
@item
@strong{[F11]} - window fullscreen mode
@item
@strong{[escape]} - exit
@end enumerate
